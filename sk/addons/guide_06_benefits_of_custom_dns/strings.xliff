        <source>Whenever you connect to a website, a DNS (domain name system) first turns the domain name (e.g. www.mozilla.org) into an IP address that allows your internet traffic to reach that destination. Typically, your ISP (internet service provider) provides you with a DNS server that your devices use automatically.</source>

        <source>Mozilla VPN allows you to choose alternative DNS servers that can offer you an additional layer of protection. In particular, you can choose a DNS server that will block ads, one that will block trackers, or one that will block both. Lastly, you can even go further and specify a custom DNS server.</source>

        <source>Note that blocking ads and trackers using DNS is not a perfect solution and that this protection is best used in combination with a browser that also protects your privacy. Like Mozilla Firefox!</source>
